# SVG Path Visualizer 📐

→ **[SVG Path Visualizer 📐](https://svg-path-visualizer.netlify.app)**

I've been working with SVGs for some time and always struggled to understand the path data syntax so I figured I'd build a visualizer for it.

Enter an SVG path data (the string inside the `d` attribute) to visualize it and discover all its different commands.
